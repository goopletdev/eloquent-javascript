# Eloquent Javascript
TypeScript solutions to the exercises in Eloquent Javascript by Marijin Haverbeke. 

For now, my code is likely not especially idiomatic to TS, but I'm hoping this will change over time as I become more familiar with the language. 

Tests are written using Jest.

## Switching back from TypeScript
Around chapter 7, I realized I was having a lot of extra trouble testing my TSCode and running it in Node than I'd like. Starting here, I'm switching back to JS.

### Incomplete:
- chapter 07: 'Robot Efficiency' I found to be challenging. I will come back to it later.
